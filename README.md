## automator folder
This folder contains apps that run applescripts. Some of the apps automate tedious tasks and other apps simply provide an alternate name for launching an application. The apps are all launchable from Spotlight.
  - `DarkMode` - you must already have F.lux and Shady installed. It launches both of those apps and turns the screen brightness of your mac down to 1 bar.
  - `LightMode` - undoes DarkMode. Quits F.lux and Shady and increases the screen brightness.
  - `Task Manager` - because sometimes I forget it's called Activity Monitor on macOS.
  - `eyedropper` - because I forget that it's called Digital Color Meter
  - `pia` - launches Tunnelblick
